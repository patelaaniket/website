                <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
                <p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
                    My most proficient language is Python, having used it the most for projects and research. The “Automated Strain Analysis using TEM Diffraction Data” 
                    and “Facial Expression Recognition” projects from my Portfolio page are prime examples of this. Other languages I am well-versed in are Java and C++. 
                    Java being the first programming language I learned in high school, and C++ being the introductory language they teach at Texas A&M, I have extensive 
                    experience using these languages, especially to complete assignments. I have used Java mostly in the context of competitive coding competitions and for 
                    multi-threading programs. C++ on the other hand has been used exclusively for <a href="https://github.com/patelaaniket/csce221" target="_blank">class assignments</a>, 
                    mostly dealing with pointers and memory management. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as seen by this website you are currently 
                    browsing, and some experience with Haskell and C.  As part of a class assignment we created a parser for the programming language W, a simple custom 
                    programming language built for this assignment, using Haskell. Another class assignment, <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" target="_blank">nand2tetris</a>, required
                     the use of HDL. Having dual-booted Ubuntu on my laptop, I am familiar with Windows and Linux operating systems.

                <h4>Technical Areas of Interest</h4>
                <p style="margin-top: 25px">
                    Ever since I took my first computer science class in tenth grade, I have been fascinated with this subject. I knew right away I wanted to pursue a career 
                    in this field, but was unaware of all the different focus areas. Now that I have more experience in the subject, I can say that my interests lie at the 
                    intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence. Autonomous vehicles, robots and computer vision is something I would like to learn more of and work 
                    with. I am also interested in software and program development in general. Please use the information in my resume to contact me if needed. Email would be 
                    the most convenient for me.
